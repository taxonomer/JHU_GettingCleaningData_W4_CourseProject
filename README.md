# Course Project - JHU Data Science - Getting and Cleaning Data 

## Contents
This repository contains the following analysis project files

* CodeBook.md -> markdown file that describes the source data, its variables, and the transformations performed to tidy up the data.
* run_analysis.R -> R script that accomplishes the process of tidying up the data (transforming the source data into a tidy form and exporting as tidydata.txt)
* tidydata.txt -> text file containing the tidy data (a result of the transformation process which is detailed in the CodeBook.md)

## Project Background

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data used in this project represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. Using R, the data scientist is tasked to tidy up the data by following a list of procedures (details are shown on the CodeBook.md) and make analysis from it.
